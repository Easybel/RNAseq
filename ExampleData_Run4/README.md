# Run4 - Biofilm vs. planktonic strains 
In this project, the idea was to compare the transcriptome of biofilm forming strains with such that live in planktonic lifestyle. The different strains were grown for 10h and the RNA was isolated for 3 replicates per strain. For more information, see the phD thesis of Isabel Rathmann & Sebastian Kraus-RÃ¶mer (groupserver AG Maier).
